# Payload-PC104 #

This repository contains schematics and footprints of the PC104 standard for CubeSats' payloads. 
These designs are compatible with Eagle and KiCad PCB design software.
The footprints have also a suggested PCB boundary that facilitates the cable management of the CubeSat.

# KiCAD #

The KiCAD's schematic includes all the necessary pins assignments to speedup the payload design. The footprint already has the edge cuts done and it follows the PC104 specification.
